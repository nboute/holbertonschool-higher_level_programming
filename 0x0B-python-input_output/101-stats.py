"""This module contains a script that reads stdin line by line

Input format: '<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1"
<status code> <file size>'

Each 10 lines and after a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), prints those
statistics since the beginning:
Total file size: File size: <total size>
where is the sum of all previous (see input format above)
Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
if a status code doesn’t appear, don’t print anything for this status code
format: <status code>: <number>
status codes should be printed in ascending order
